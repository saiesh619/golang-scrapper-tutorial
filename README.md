Level 1: HTTP Fetch + goquery -

Level 2: List Extraction 

Level 3: Link‑Following Crawl (Depth 1)

Level 4: Colly Basic Scraper 

Level 5: Pagination Handling 

Level 6: JSON & AJAX Endpoints 

Level 7: Authentication & Sessions 

Level 8: Rate‑Limiting, Proxies & UA Rotation 

Level 9: robots.txt, sitemaps & Data Storage 

Level 10: Distributed & Headless Crawler 

Advanced

Level 11: Modern SPA & GraphQL Crawling  
Crawl React/Vue/Angular single‑page apps by reverse‑engineering their GraphQL or REST‑JSON endpoints. Handle dynamic cursors, send proper headers (e.g. mobile UA, auth tokens), and stitch paginated GraphQL responses into your data model.

Level 12: Deep‑Web & Multi‑Media Extraction  
Automate form‑driven flows (search forms, infinite scroll), scrape behind login walls and web sockets, and extract content from PDFs, DOCX, slides and images via OCR. Build a pipeline that normalizes unstructured text from HTML, PDF and image sources.

Level 13: Semantic Enrichment & Knowledge Graphs  
Apply NLP to your raw data: entity recognition, relation extraction, coreference resolution. Design a graph schema to link people, places, events and concepts. Ingest your crawled corpus into a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) so you can ask complex “who did what when” queries.

Level 14: Distributed, Polite Web‑Scale Crawling  
Evolve your single‑node crawler into a fault‑tolerant cluster:  
• Sharded frontier management with priority queues  
• Centralized URL de‑duplication (Bloom filters + Redis)  
• Auto-scaling workers in Kubernetes  
• Fine‑grained politeness policies per domain (per‑site QPS, adaptive backoff)

Level 15: Search & RAG Research Pipeline  
Build an end‑to‑end research engine:  
• Chunk and embed your enriched documents into a vector store (e.g. Pinecone, Milvus)  
• Expose a search API for semantic similarity and metadata filters  
• Integrate with an LLM as a Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) layer so you can issue “deep research” queries and get context‑aware summaries
